      personalInformation: `Currently I am working on a project, 
which can automate the administration and the quality control procedures 
for a cleaning company in the hotel industry.The ideas come partially from me, 
the execution is my work guided by the feedback from my manager. 
Recently I have got the idea for a late career change to achieve my full potential
and use my stronger mathematics and problem solving skills.I have realized that 
I should go back to the field,which I had formally studied and used to work in,but
unfortunately I have never completed my formal education fully.In the current situation
I have to wait to sell the project to the company,but I do not mind it,because solving 
problems by computers is good fun.I am looking for a company, which can lift my skills
and experience to professional level and in exchange can use my ideas and problem solving 
skills.My skills in web development are reaching from Linux, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, 
JavaScript ES5, ES6, TypeScript, Angular, React and my toolset is growing as I keep on
going with my training.`,

        description: `It was a 4 years long IT engineering course with the apropriate exam levels.
We learned about hardware and software as well from the basics.The software started from the algorithms 
and data structures and went up towards OOP.The language of the training was Pascal that time. We also
learnt some Delphi, C, C++, Java and even some assembly programming of micro controllers.We had an excessive
subject about hardware architecture and we also learned about networking.Unfortunately I have only completed
3 years out of the 4 and never graduated with them.I've managed to find a junior developer position in Hungary
and I thought that I didn't need that lot's of theory to build up a career. I might have been right if the
recession had not happened in 2008, when I became redundant and I decided to come to the UK.`,

It wasn't easy, but I've managed to do it nicely. The only problem, that I needed to do jobs, which I
was over qualified for.I couldn't get a developer position without speaking English very well.I picked
up some freelance work from time to time just to keep my skills alive and tried to learn new technologies.
During all these years the technology has improved a lot, so I decided to actualize my knowledge with a
free online course, which is the best available on the web.I've found The Odin Project, which I've
been doing actively since January 2020 before the first COVID-19 lockdown happened.`,
